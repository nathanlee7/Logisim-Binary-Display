# Logisim-Binary-Display
These logisim programs use 2-bit and 4-bit binary inputs to display the decimal equivalent to a 7-segment display wired from the inputs. With the usage of logic gates and inverters, the programs successfully display the decimal value given a binary input within the allowed range depending on how many bits are inputted.
